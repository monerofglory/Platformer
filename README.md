#Platformer
A simple platformer to demonstrated C++ abilities and game development knowledge. This game is a technical demonstration, it is not particularly fun/aesthetic!

This platformer demonstrates the use of a fluid, moving character that jumps around platforms collecting yellow squares. Whilst graphically simple, it is intended to demonstrate the following:

- Temporal movement based on delta time (fluid motion)
- Understanding of C++
- Understanding of OpenGL
- Understanding of more complex mathematics in game development (see collision/sine function jumping)
- Good commenting/git maintenance.
